            <h2>Quran</h2>
            <p class="center-align">The Quran is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from Allah SWT. 
                The Quran, revered as the ultimate divine revelation in Islam, is a profound and timeless guide that illuminates the path to righteousness for over a billion Muslims worldwide. It is more than just a holy book; it is the very heartbeat of Islamic faith and practice, encapsulating the wisdom and guidance of Allah SWT in a language of unparalleled beauty and eloquence. For us Muslims, the Quran is a living miracle, a direct communication from the Creator to His creation, providing answers to the deepest questions of existence, morality, and the hereafter. Its verses, recited in a profound way of Tajweed, resonate deeply within the soul, offering solace in times of distress and clarity in moments of confusion. The Quran is a source of spiritual nourishment, an unerring compass in the journey of life, and a bond that unites the diverse tapestry of the Muslim Ummah under the banner of faith.</p>

                      <br> <b>Surah Al-Ankabut (29:69):</b> <br>

                    <br> <b> Surah Al-Nahl (16:18):</b>  <br>

                    "And if you should count the favors of Allah SWT, you could not enumerate them..."   <br>

                <br> <b> Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286):</b>  <br>

                "Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people." <br> 
            <br> <b> Surah Al-Zumar (39:53):</b>    <br>
            "Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'"     <br>
              <br> <b> Surah Al-Anbiya (21:87-88):</b>   <br>
              "And [mention] the man of the fish, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not decree anything upon him. And he called out within the darknesses, 'There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.' So We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus do We save the believers." <br>

              So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not be ungrateful."

            <h2>Hadiths</h2>
            <p class="center-align">Hadiths are the collections of the sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad SAW (Peace Be Upon Him).
                Hadiths hold a special place in the hearts of Muslims, as they are the recorded sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad SAW. These teachings complement the Quran, offering practical examples of how to live a righteous and fulfilling life. Each hadith provides valuable insights into the Prophet SAW's wisdom, compassion, and guidance on matters of faith, ethics, and everyday living. For Muslims, hadiths serve as a rich source of inspiration and a guide to emulating the Prophet SAW's exemplary character. They are cherished not only for their spiritual significance but also for their role in fostering a deeper understanding of Islamic principles and values.

            <h3>Some Hadiths</h3>
            <p class="center-align"> 
                There are two words which are light on the tongue, heavy on the scale, and loved by the Most Merciful: SubhanAllahi wa bihamdi, SubhanAllahi al-azeem (Glorified is Allah and praised is He, Glorified is Allah the Most Great). <br>

<b>(Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim) </b> <br>
 <br>A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said, “O Messenger of Allah! Who among the people has the most right to my good company?” He replied, “Your mother.” The man said, “Then who?” He replied, “Your mother.” The man said, “Then who?” He replied, “Your mother.” The man said, “Then who?” He replied, “Then your father.” <br>
      <b>(Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim)</b> <br>
      <br> The one who looks after a widow or poor person is like the one who strives in the cause of Allah – and I think he also said – he is like the one who continuously stands for prayer without slacking and fasts without breaking. <br>     
      <b>(Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim)</b> <br>
      <br> The fire is surrounded by [unlawful] desires and paradise by difficulties. <br>
      <b>(Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim)</b> <br>
      <br>A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: My riding beast has been killed, so give me some animal to ride upon. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have none with me. A man said: Messenger of Allah, I can guide him to one who will provide him with a riding beast. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: One who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer. <br>
      <b>(Sahih Muslim)</b> <br>
      <br> Abu Sufyan reported it on the authority of Jabir that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say:
      When Satan hears the call to prayer, he runs away to a distance like that of Rauha. Sulaimin said: I asked him about Rauha. He replied: It is at a distance of thirty-six miles from Medina. <br>
      <b>(Sahih Muslim)</b> <br>
      <br>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
      Let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day speak good, or keep silent; and let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day be generous to his neighbour; and let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day be generous to his guest. <br>
      <b> (40 Hadith an-Nawawi)</b> <br>
      <br> On the authority of Abu Dharr Jundub ibn Junadah, and Abu Abdur-Rahman Muadh bin Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
      Have taqwa (fear) of Allah wherever you may be, and follow up a bad deed with a good deed which will wipe it out, and behave well towards the people. <br>It was related by at-Tirmidhi, who said it was a hasan (good) hadeeth, and in some copies it is stated to be a hasan saheeh hadeeth. <br>
      <b> (40 Hadith an-Nawawi)</b> <br>
      <br>On the authority of Abu `Amr — and he is also called Abu `Amrah — Sufyan bin Abdullah ath- Thaqafee (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: <br>
I said, "O Messenger of Allah, tell me something about al-Islam which I can ask of no one but you." He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, "Say I believe in Allah — and then be steadfast." <br>
